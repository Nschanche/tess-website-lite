Here we list some common questions not addressed above.  

**How do I convert a TESS magnitude into a flux?**

The flux in e/s can be estimated via the following equation:

Flux [e-/s] = 10<sup>(20.44-Tmag/2.5)</sup>

This is derived from the values presented on page 37 of the <a href = 'https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/active-missions/tess/_documents/TESS_Instrument_Handbook_v0.1.pdf'>Instrument hand book</a>.

**Is there proprietary period on TESS data?**

No, all TESS data becomes immediately public when it arrives in the TESS archive <a href = 'https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/'>MAST</a>. The approximate date of data availability for a given sector can be found <a href = 'https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/TESS/TESS+Holdings+Available+by+MAST+Service'> here </a>.

**What if I have an interesting and timely target that needs to be observed quickly and in short-cadence?**

Target of opportunity proposals are solicited for rapidly evolving phenomena whose occurrence is not predictable at the time of the GI proposal deadline. These proposals would commence after the spacecraft upload following the trigger event, which could be as long as 2 months after the event. The impact to science of such a potential delay must be addressed in proposals requesting ToO observations. These proposals may be submitted during the regular cycle and are eligible for funding.

Additionally, a fraction of the GI targets will be reserved for rapid turn-around, Director's Discretionary Time (DDT). If your target can't wait for the next GI proposal cycle, then DDT is the route for you. Keep in mind that (i) targets need to be submitted about 6 weeks before they can to be observed; and (ii) the spacecraft has to be observing the corresponding region of the sky.

**Is there a standard acknowledgement to use when publishing TESS data?**

 This paper includes data collected by the TESS mission, which are publicly available from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). Funding for the TESS mission is provided by NASA's Science Mission directorate.

**How can I get media coverage for my awesome new science result from TESS?**

You can request support for your exciting new science result from NASA Goddard's Astrophysics Divisions Communications Team by following the instructions [on this webpage](media.html). People are encouraged to submit requests for media support 6 weeks before the paper is expected to be published by a journal.

**Where can I send my suggestion for an idea I'd like to see incorporated into the TESS GI program, or a software tool I'd like to suggest be developed?**

 We love feedback! Please contact our [helpdesk](helpdesk.html) with any suggestions or questions.

**I see an interesting feature in my TESS light curve. What could it be?**

Some common sources of anomalous light curves features include the target star being on a bad CCD column or scattered light from the Earth and/or Moon. It is recommended that Full-Frame Images taken at the same time as the anomalous feature be checked to verify whether or not the interesting feature seen is astrophysical in nature.

## Miscellaneous

**Media support**

NASA can provide media support that can help amplify your results so that they reach a wide audience. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Astrophysics Division Communications Team has extensive experience creating press products based on results: from coordinating and writing web features and press releases, producing supporting videos, and commissioning animations, and even planning a press event if the result is significant enough.

Submit a <a href = "https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/media_req_tess/"> TESS Media Coverage Request </a> for media support consideration. The team needs an adequate heads up of your coming results, about six weeks in most cases. Please consider submitting a media request at the same time you submit a paper for publication, and *before submitting it to a preprint server (like arXiv)*.

A copy of this form will be emailed to the Goddard's Astrophysics Division Communications Team Leadership: Amber Straughn, Claire Saravia, Frank Reddy, Barb Mattson, and Jeanette Kazmierczak. If a paper is associated with this submission, please also send a current draft of your paper to TESS' Media Contact [Claire Saravia, Office of Communications](mailto:claire.g.desaravia@nasa.gov).
