On this page you can find some of the key statistics about the TESS mission, including the publication rate of TESS, and where our authors are from. 

## TESS Publications
This plot shows the number of peer-reviewed journal articles utilizing TESS data over time. The TESS papers are further broken up into papers related to exoplanets or astrophysics, which in this context is all applications outside of exoplanets. The trend indicates that TESS is being increasingly used for purposes outside of the primary mission goal.
