Title: Proposing to the TESS General Investigator program

NASA's TESS is a space-based telescope that images large parts of the sky in the visible at a cadence of 2 minutes or less. TESS observes the same part of the sky continually for 28 days. TESS provides users with three different kinds of data products: 
* Target Pixel Files
* Light Curves
* Full Frame Images

TESS data is public, and provides all-sky, space-based, long-duration (30+ days) precision photometry for tens of millions of sources. TESS enables studies of exoplanet systems, single and multiple stars, supernovae, galaxies, Solar System objects.  All data is made available through MAST immediately after data processing and validation is complete.

## What is the TESS GI program?

**Users can obtain both data and funding through the TESS General Investigator Program.** TESS obtains Full Frame Images during it's mission, and a for a subset of targets provides Target Pixel Files and Light Curves. These products have a shorter cadence, have background removed, and are corrected by the TESS pipeline. In order to obtain Target Pixel Files and Light Curves of targets, users must propose through the GI Program.

The GI Program provides:

* Targets selected by the community which will be observed and delivered as TPFs and LCs (with systematics removed)
* Funding for research with any TESS mission data products (including FFIs) and any ground based programs that directly support TESS research. 
The primary purpose of the TESS General Investigator Program is to enhance and maximize the science return from TESS.

Below you can find more information on how to propose for TESS data and research funding.
