The primary purpose of the TESS General Investigator (GI) Program is to enhance and maximize the science return from the mission. Users can obtain both data and funding through the TESS GI Program. The program facilitates and supports short-cadence observations with TESS as well as research undertaken with the Full-Frame Images.
<br> Note that the TESS GI program is for new TESS data only (ZZZZTHIS MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTUREZZZ) </br>
<br> Below you can find more information on the TESS General Investigator (GI) Program and how to propose for TESS data and research funding. </br>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Who can submit a TESS GI proposal?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <ul style=“list-style-type:circle”>
            <br>Anyone is eligible to submit a TESS GI Program.</br>
            <br>To recieve funding through the TESS GI Program, you must be based at a US institution.</br>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">What should I include in my proposal?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <ul style=“list-style-type:circle”>
            <br>Proposals may utilize any combination of 2-minute cadence, 20-second cadence, and the Full-Frame Image data.</br>
            <br>The proposal should provide a compelling, timely, and relevant scientific and technical justification.</br>
            <br>The science justification may include, but is not limited to: exoplanet detection and characterization, stellar astrophysics, galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and Solar System science.</br>
            <br>The technical justification should be clearly described and sufficiently detailed to support the science case.</br>
            <br>All except the mini proposals should also provide at least one paragraph for the work plan detailing how the proposed effort will be carried out.</br>
            <br>The work plan should include the allocation of effort amongst investigators. This should be expressed in terms of each participant's role in the investigation to preserve the anonymity of the document.</br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Selecting your TESS Targets</button>
<div class="content">
    <ul style=“list-style-type:circle”>
        <br>How do I find out if TESS can observe my targets?</br>
        <br>With the coordinates in hand, you can use the <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tess/webtess/wtv.py" target="_blank">Web TESS Viewing tool</a></br>
        <br>Another option to check target observability is the freely-available <a href="https://github.com/tessgi/tess-point" target="_blank">TESS-Point software</a></br>
    </ul>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Writing your Proposal</button>
<div class="content">
    <ul style=“list-style-type:circle”>
        <br>How many proposals can I submit?</br>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:square>
          <br>As many as you want!</br>
          <br>Note that total amount of funding available is fixed. Thus if you submit multiple proposals you may be competing with yourself!</br>
        </ul>
        <br>How do I make my proposal dual-anonymous compliant?</br>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:square>
          <br>NSPIRES is a great resource for dual-anonymous compliance. You can consult the <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=736703/solicitationId=%7B4B9CAAB3-D398-183A-B1F3-EF963DF415C7%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/Guidelines%20for%20Anonymous%20Proposals%20DAPR%20Doc%20Astro%20GO%20Programs.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals</a> PDF document for specific instructions. Note that this link will automatically download the PDF to your machine.</br>
          <br>Note that the instructions provided in the "Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals" supersede the default instructions given in the NASA</br>
          <br>The "Guidelines for Anonymous Proposals" document also contains complete information on how to write the required "Expertise and Resources - Not Anonymized" document.</br>
          <br>When writing the anonymous part of your Phase-1 proposal, make sure to eliminate language that identifies you or your institution. For example, instead of using "...as we demonstrated in Smith et al. (2022)..." you can instead use "...as demonstrated by [1]...", and then put [1] into the reference list. Another example of compliance issue could be "...we have guaranteed time on our 1.5-m campus telescope at the University of Maryland...". Instead, you can say "...we have guaranteed time on a 1.5-m telescope..." and then describe the facility in the "Expertise and Resources - Not Anonymized" part of the Phase-1 proposal.</br>
          <br>Speaking of references, they should always be in a [1], [2], [3] format in the main body of the proposal.</br>
          <br>NASA understands that dual-anonymous peer review represents a major shift in the evaluation of proposals, and as such there may be occasional slips in writing anonymized proposals.</br>
          <br>However, NASA reserves the right to return without review proposals that are particularly egregious in terms of the identification of the proposing team.</br>
        </ul>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Submitting your Proposal</button>
<div class="content">
    <ul style=“list-style-type:circle”>
        <br>How do I submit a proposal?</br>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:square>
          <br>The TESS GI program uses a two-step proposal process. Phase-1 presents the scientific/technical justification. If a Phase-1 proposal is accepted and requests funding, a Phase-2 budget justification is required. All proposal materials are submitted electronically through the <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/rps/" target="_blank">ARK/RPS portal </a>.</br>
          <br>The <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ark/rps/" target="_blank">ARK/RPS portal </a> has two pages: a cover page for general information and a second page for uploading the science justification and other files. The uploaded files can be updated as many times as needed before the deadline.</br>
          <br>The TESS Science Support Center provides provides a number of freely-available tools, tutorials, guidelines, examples, and other materials to facilitate the preparation and submission process. You can find more information here.</br>
        </ul>
        <br>When are the proposals due?</br>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:square>
          <br>Proposals are solicited once a year, typically in the spring. You can find more details on <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/" target="_blank">NSPIRES</a></br>
        </ul>
    </ul>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Proposal Evaluations</button>
<div class="content">
    <ul style=“list-style-type:circle”>
        <br>NASA recognizes and supports the benefits of having diverse and inclusive scientific, engineering, and technology communities and fully expects that such values will be reflected in the composition of the peer review panels and the proposal teams.</br>
        <br>All proposals are peer-reviewed and ranked by a panel of professional volunteers through a double-blind process, followed by ratification from NASA Headquarters.</br>
        <br>The members of the peer-review panel will not be disclosed.</br>
        <br>The deliberations of the panel will be disclosed to PIs only after ratification by the selecting official.</br>
        <br>The review panels will evaluate the anonymized proposals based on their scientific merit, without initially taking into account the proposing team qualifications.</br>
        <br>Only after the scientific evaluation is finalized for all proposals, the panel will review the "Expertise and Resources - Not Anonymized" documents.</br>
        <br>The panel will validate the qualifications of the team in order to allow the reviewers to assess the team capabilities required to execute a given proposed science investigation.</br>
        <br>Is there a specific type of proposals and/or science areas that are more likely to be successful? The TESS GI program supports a wide variety of scientific proposals covering multiple aspects of astrophysics. All proposal are evaluated equally.</br>
